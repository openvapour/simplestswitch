# SimplestSwitch

The most simple OpenFlow switch you will find anywhere.

It switches packets from port1 to port2 (and back again).

SimplestSwitch provides an OpenFlow1.0 and OpenFlow1.3 implementation in Ryu.

## Why?

Useful for testing new switches to see if they support the OpenFlow versions they claim to.

## Running

Run with ryu-manager:

```
$ ryu-manager simplest_switch1X.py
```
